### training
This directory is about training transformers (base/transformer.py) on quantum game
datasets (dataset) which can be found in training.py. Furthermore, there are
utility functions to validate and test the models on small samples of the dataset.
The mixed, random and symmetric folders store trained models which have been 
trained on different kinds of datasets (see dataset/README.md).
