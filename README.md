# quantum-game-theory

This repository investigates reinforcement learning algorithms to solve quantum games.

TODO:
- understand differentiable quantum computing: https://pennylane.ai/
- stabilize learning process
- design quantum framework
- design algorithm learning the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm (optional)
